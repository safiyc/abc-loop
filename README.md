# ABC Loop
### By Safiy Cham

## Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Description

An educational app to teach my nephew and kids ABC with words, images, and sounds by pressing a letter on the keyboard or clicking/touching on a letter block. Each letter has 4 levels. As the user triggers a letter consecutively, the program loops through words associated with said letter. The loop resets to level 1 of all letters when a triggered letter is different from the previous letter.

## Pending Tasks
* Img into view; from left, right, bottom (js: add css class (random .left, .right, .bottom), which has css animation)
* Improve glass window effect (css animate window; 'flash' on letter click?)
* Use colors to separate syllables of words
* Revise to ES6
* DRY

## Bugs/Issues
* ABC song audio is not synced to images of letters
